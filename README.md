This is mxcl's GitX

It is designed to be the visual complement to using the command line. The command
line git tool is great. However it is not ideal for:

* Committing
* Viewing the tree

GitX is for those things. Nothing else. Nothing else at all.

Install the command line tool "gitx" or you will not enjoy using gitx.
